🛠️ Dynamic Queue Management: Add and skip song with intuitive commands.

Why I built this bot:

My cousins and me had a bot from maki.gg to play music. But its catalog isn't too diverse and some song can only be found
using link from apple music or spotify. Underated song that isn't available on these platform can't be play using this bot. 
Therefore I built this bot that can access Youtube search (has the most diverse song database) and retrieve stream using youtubedl
and play directly our server.

Features in Progress:

🎧 Continuous improvements to song search functionality.
📂 Exploring integration with other music sources.
🔄 Additional commands for customization and playlist management.
